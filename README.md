# Financial Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced financial dataset.

We applied supervised machine learning techniques and compared two models:

- Logistic Regression

- Random Forest

# Project Workflow

    - Data Cleaning.
    
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – visualized class imbalance and feature distributions.
    
    - Model Training & Evaluation – trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest, then compared their performance.
    
    - Deployment – built an interactive Streamlit application to test predictions in real-time.

# Main Libraries

    - scikit-learn
    
    - pandas
    
    - matplotlib
    
    - seaborn
    
    - streamlit
